    <p><strong>How teams, projects, and expeditions relate to each other:</strong></p>
      <img

      />
      <p></p>

    <p><strong>Teams</strong></p>
A team is a shared configuration where users create projects which having a common set of rules, attributes, and controlled vocabulary terms.  Join a team workspace if you have been invited to do so and if you agree to use all of the attributes, rules, and controlled vocabularies for that team. The concept of a team workspace is used for enterprises where many users will be working together in a shared environment.  To create a project within a team workspace, select "Join team workspace" during the project creation process and then select the appropriate team.  The team administrator controls all configuration options and project owners must accept these decisions. The following public team workspaces are available in GEOME:

  <project-info></project-info>

    <p><strong>Projects</strong></p>
A project has one owner, who may invite additional members.  If a project is created as part of a team, the project owner does not have the ability to alter the set of available attributes, rules, or controlled vocabularies.  If a project is created independent of a team, the project owner may configure available attributes, rules, or controlled vocabularies during project creation, or later by visiting the “project configuration” option in the workbench.   When creating a project indendepent from a team, you will have the choice to either create a single sheet project or a multiple sheet project.  A single sheet project is conceptually simpler to implement as all event, sample, and tissue metadata is entered onto a single sheet.  The advantage of a multiple worksheet project is that you reduce duplicate data entry for "parent" entities (You only need to enter a row 1 time and the uniqueKey can be referenced in other worksheets). The disadvantage is that it requires more work on the users part by needing to associate identifier keys between sheets.

  <p></p>
    <p><strong>Expeditions</strong></p>
  An expedition corresponds to a single spreadsheet, containing all related events, samples, and tissues.  All data entered into GEOME must be entered as an expedition. Any member of a project may create an expedition when they first upload a spreadsheet. The expedition owner retains the right to update or alter expedition data as well as setting the expedition to public or private viewing.  The project owner also has the capability to alter expedition metadata of any user within the project.  Expedition identifiers can be set as unique either within the expedition itself or across the project.  Finally, each expedition provides a globally unique and resolvable prefix (expedition root identifier) for each entity.  When a local identifier, which is enforced as unique either within an expedition or project, is appended to the expedition root identifier, it services as a resolvable and globally unique representation for each instance of a collecting event, sample, or tissue. The provision of these identifiers happens automatically, and is noted within the system as BCIDs (biocode commons identifiers).

  <div uib-accordion-group class="panel-default md-whiteframe-2dp" heading="History">
    <p>
      GEOME has its roots in the Moorea Biocode project database, developed from 2006 to 2011 to
      support data collection for the Moore Foundation funded Moorea Biocode Project: an all taxa
      biotic inventory of a single tropical island involving 6 teams, 50 researchers, and thousands
      of collecting events. The Moorea Biocode field information management system, also known as
      "FIMS1", was developed to ingest spreadsheet data from researchers working on the project and
      employed data validation on data ingest. The tools were written in Perl and Java. FIMS1 has
      been running from 2006 through 2018 and developed tools such as the Plate Matcher (to easily
      map tissues to 96 well plates), the bioValidator (for loading and validating spreadsheets),
      and a web interface for managing data.
    </p>
    <p>
      From 2012 to 2015, the National Science Foundation funded the BiSciCol (Biological Sciences
      Collections) project. While BiSciCol focused on identifiers, ontologies, and semantic
      technologies for linking biodiversity data, the primary use case was to work on a solution for
      linking events, samples, and tissues across many different systems using linked data
      technology with the Moorea Biocode Project data integration with member institution databases.
      BiScicol brought us the following products: a clearer understanding of the role of persistent
      identifiers, the
      <a href="https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-15-257"
        >BiSciCol triplifier</a
      >, the development of the
      <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0089606">
        Biological Collections Ontology (BCO)</a
      >, and the development of FIMS2, also known as the
      <a href="http://biscicol.org/">BiSciCol FIMS</a>. The BiSciCol FIMS adopted ARK identifiers
      (through California Digital Library's EZID system) for all samples, events and tissues. In
      addition, all data inserted into BiSciCol FIMS was backed by a Fuseki triplestore with
      metadata configurations specified using an XML configuration file, stored and managed
      separately by each project.
    </p>
    <p>
      From 2014-2017, BiSciCol FIMS began hosting the Diversity of the IndoPacific Network (DIPNet)
      to develop a coherent metadata repository for assembling metadata from across the IndoPacific
      region. DIPNet added the ability to upload FASTA and FASTQ metadata to the FIMS2 site and also
      developed the name "GEOME" (eventually becaming the brand name for FIMS3). During this
      time-frame, another FIMS system was developed for the Smithosnian National Museum of Natural
      History ("NMNH FIMS") with the goal of creating a centralized field data ingestion system for
      all NMNH field data. The NMNH FIMS has since been discontinued with SI users using the
      BiSciCol FIMS (Barcode of Wildlife Project, ARMS portal, and Global Genome Initiative) and
      FIMS1 installations (Invertebrate Zoology and LAB applications).
    </p>
    <p>
      Beginning in 2016, John Deck and RJ Ewing started work on a redesigned FIMS system, utilizing
      a Postgres backend to control project management features and JSON metadata objects to store
      data and configurations. This FIMS system (FIMS3) assumed the name GEOME. It incorporates
      features from FIMS1 (including photo uploading, specimen, tissue, and event pages,
      plate-matching tools) along with features of the BiSciCol FIMS (persistent id generation,
      flexible project configuration with attributes stored in a non-relational system guided by a
      configuration file). In addition, FIMS3 brings in the concept of a network which governs
      multiple configuration templates and the ability to easily create projects through a user
      interface. The goal of GEOME is to integrate all previous FIMS1 and FIMS2, with FIMS1 and
      FIMS2 projects removed from their current hosting environment by Spring of 2019.
