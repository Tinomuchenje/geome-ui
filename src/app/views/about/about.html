  <h2>About the Genomic Observatories Metadatabase</h2>
  <p>
    The Genomic Observatories Meta-Database (GeOMe) is a web-based database which captures metadata on biological
    samples.  GeOMe satisfies the requirements of the
    <a href="https://gigascience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2047-217X-3-2">genomic observatories model</a>,
    including capturing the who, what, where, and when associated with all samples. All GeOMe terms are drawn, whenever
    possible, from community standard vocabularies, including <a href="http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/">Darwin Core</a> and 
    <a href="http://gensc.org/mixs/">MIxS</a>.  Click on the headings below to expand each topic with more information.

    <p>
    Welcome to GeOMe! There are several routes you can take to get started.  The path you take depends on if you need to
    read data, write data, or specify attributes and rules in a new project.  The following describes routes you can choose 
    to get started:</p>

    <p>
      <strong><u>Route 1</u>: I want to query public data or generate a template</strong>
      <br>Most GeOMe projects are marked as "public", which means that anyone can query public data or generate that
      project's templates.  Most projects let any visitor (regardless of whether they have a login) dynamically create spreadsheet templates.  
      Read the <a href='docs/helpDocumentation.pdf' target=_blank>GeOMe Help Document</a> to get started 
      using the web interface for generating templates and querying data.</br>
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong><u>Route 2</u>: I want to contribute data to an existing project</strong>
      <br>See the <a ng-click="$ctrl.openProjects()">GeOMe projects page</a> to read about current GeOMe projects. 
      Contact the project administrator of the project you would like to join and they will either create a new account 
      for you or associate your existing account to their project.  Read the 
      <a href='docs/helpDocumentation.pdf' target=_blank>GeOMe Help Document</a> to get started using the web interface.</br>
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong><u>Route 3</u>: I want to create a new project, synchronized with a network approved configuration</strong>
      <br>If you choose to create a project that is synchronized with a network approved configuration, you will receive all
      updates and additions of data attributes, rules, and lookup lists of the network approved configuration. 
      Creating any new project currently requires sending an email request to <a href="mailto:geome.help@gmail.com">geome.help@gmail.com</a> 
      with a brief statement of what your project involves.</br>
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong><u>Route 4</u>: I want to create a new project, un-synchronized with a network approved configuration</strong>
      <br>If you choose to create a project that is un-synchronized with a network approved configuration, you will either start
      from scratch or you can choose to clone a network approved configuration.  If your project is un-syncrhonized, then you are
      free to make your own changes and additions to your project configuration and you will not receive any changes made by the
      network approved configuration.  Creating a new project currently requires sending an email request to 
      <a href="mailto:geome.help@gmail.com">geome.help@gmail.com</a> with a brief statement of what your project involves.</br>
    </p>

    <p><b><u>Glossary</u></b>:</p>

    <p><i>Generate a template</i> (see Workbench -> "Generate Template") enables the user to create and download a spreadsheet template useful for guiding
    data entry.  For public proejcts, you do not need a user account to generate a template.</p>

    <p><i>Validate Data</i> (see Workbench -> "Load Data") enables the user to validate data for selected projects.  For public projects, you can 
    check the "Only validate data" box to validate your spreadsheet data without being a project member.  </p>

    <p><i>Load Data</i> (see Workbench -> "Load Data") enables the user to submit data for a project that you have access to.</p>

    <p><i>Create project</i> (interface functions in development) tools enables the user to manage their own project data within GeOMe.
    We are working on a project creation wizard to guide users into easily creating their own projects on the website.  Meanwhile users can
    contact send an email to <a href="mailto:geome.help@gmail.com">geome.help@gmail.com</a> to create a new project. Projects can either
    adopt a network approved configuration, clone an existing project, or build a project from scratch. </p>

    <p><i>Newtork approved configurations</i> are templates adopted by a set of projects that share a common set of rules and attributes.
    If a project adopts a network approved configuration, then that project accepts all rules, attributes, and lists from the network 
    approved configuration.  During project creation, if the project creator chooses to synchronize with the network approved configuration then
    when all updates to rules, attributes and lists are controlled by the network administrator.  On the other hand, if the project creator chooses
    to NOT synchronize with the network approved configuration then the project can control its own rules, attributes, and lists.
    Currently deployed network approved configurations are visible on the <a ng-click="$ctrl.openProjects()">GeOMe projects page</a>.
These projects follow on the spirit and principals of the Diversity of the IndoPacific project.

    <p>
    GeOMe has its roots in the Moorea Biocode project database, developed from 2006 to 2011 to support data collection for the 
    Moore Foundation funded Moorea Biocode Project: an all taxa biotic inventory of a single tropical island involving 6 teams, 50 researchers,
    and thousands of collecting events.  The Moorea Biocode field information management system, also known as "FIMS1", was developed
    to ingest spreadsheet data from researchers working on the project and employed data validation on data ingest.  The tools were
    written in Perl and Java.  FIMS1 has been running from 2006 through 2018 and 
    developed tools such as the Plate Matcher (to easily map tissues to 96 well plates), the bioValidator (for loading and validating spreadsheets), 
    and a web interface for managing data.
    </p>
    <p>
    From 2012 to 2015, the National Science Foundation funded the BiSciCol (Biological Sciences Collections) project.
    While BiSciCol focused on identifiers, ontologies, and semantic technologies for linking biodiversity data, the primary use case
    was to work on a solution for linking events, samples, and tissues across many different systems using linked data technology with the
    Moorea Biocode Project data integration with member institution databases.  The project
    had mixed results but did result in several achievements: a clearer understanding of the role of persistent identifiers, building 
    a darwin core triplifier, the development
    of the Biological Collections Ontology (BCO), and the development of FIMS2, also known as "BiSciCol FIMS" (http://biscicol.org/)   The BiSciCol FIMS 
    adopted ARK identifiers (through California Digital Library's EZID system) for all samples, events and tissues.   In addition,
    all data inserted into BiSciCol FIMS was backed by a Fuseki triplestore with metadata configurations specified using an XML configuration file, stored
    and managed separately by each project. 
    </p>
    <p>
    From 2014-2017, BiSciCol FIMS began hosting the Diversity of the IndoPacific Network (DIPNet) to develop a coherent metadata repository for
    assembling metadata from across the IndoPacific region.  DIPNet added the ability to upload FASTA and FASTQ metadata to the FIMS2 site and also 
    developed the name "GeOMe" (eventually becaming the brand name for FIMS3).
    During this time-frame, another FIMS system was developed for the Smithosnian National Museum of Natural History ("NMNH FIMS") with the goal
    of creating a centralized field data ingestion system for all NMNH field data.  The NMNH FIMS has since been discontinued with SI users 
    using the BiSciCol FIMS (Barcode of Wildlife Project, ARMS portal, and Global Genome Initiative) and FIMS1 installations (Invertebrate Zoology and LAB applications).
    </p>
    <p>
    Beginning in 2016, John Deck and RJ Ewing started work on a redesigned FIMS system, utilizing a Postgres backend to control project management features and JSON metadata 
    objects to store data and configurations.   This FIMS system (FIMS3) assumed the name GeOMe.   It incorporates features from FIMS1 (including photo uploading,
    specimen, tissue, and event pages, plate-matching tools) along with features of the BiSciCol FIMS (persistent id generation, flexible project configuration with attributes stored
    in a non-relational system guided by a configuration file).  In addition, FIMS3 brings in the concept of a network which governs multiple configuration templates and the 
    ability to easily create projects through a user interface.   The goal of GeOMe is to integrate all previous FIMS1 and FIMS2, with FIMS1 and FIMS2 projects removed from their
    current hosting environment by Spring of 2019.
