  <div>
    <p>
      The Genomic Observatories Meta-Database (GeOMe) is a web-based database which captures metadata on biological samples, used
      for biodiversity inventories, population studies, and environmental metagenomics. GeOMe satisfies the requirements
      of the
      <a href="https://gigascience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2047-217X-3-2">genomic observatories model</a>, including capturing the who, what, where, and when associated with all samples. GeOMe
      draws on both the
      <a href="http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/">Darwin Core</a> and the
      <a href="http://gensc.org/mixs/">Minimum Information about any type of Sequence (MIxS)</a> standards.

  <h3 id="help" class="md-headline">Getting Started</h3>
  Welcome to GeOMe! For read access to public projects, you do not need an account and may create project-specific templates
  and query data. If you would like to contribute data to an existing project, you will need to contact the project administrator
  for access (see below). The project administrator of existing projects will create an account for you so that you will
  be able to load data. Creating a new project currently requires sending an email request to
  <a href="mailto:geome.help@gmail.com">geome.help@gmail.com</a> with a brief statement of what your project involves. The GeOMe team will be in touch about getting
  you setup.

  <h3 id="workflowDiagram" class="md-headline">GeOMe Workflow Diagram</h3>
  The following diagram shows how data is managed in the GeOMe environment. Boxes in solid blue indicate GeOMe functions that
  the user interacts with, such as generating templates and loading data. The white boxes with a green border are functions
  that happen outside of the GeOMe environment, such as data entry into a spreadsheet.

  <h3 id="rpackage" class="md-headline">Query GeOMe using "R"</h3>
  <p>You can query datasets that have been loaded to the GeOMe database using our
    <a href="https://github.com/DIPnet/fimsR-access">R package</a>. Please note, the R package was released for version 1 of the GeOMe site and has not yet been fully tested
    with the current release. If you encounter issues, please contact the development team.

  <h3 id="limsPlugin" class="md-headline">The Biocode LIMS Plugin</h3>
  <p style="margin-top:20px;">
    Data uploaded to GeOMe can be manipulated in a laboratory information management system (LIMS) using a specially built
    <a href="http://software.mooreabiocode.org/">LIMS plugin</a> that operates within the Geneious environment. The purpose of the LIMS tool is to help manage lab and
    sequence analysis workflows. Note the name of the "LIMS plugin" for GeOMe is referred to as the "Biocode LIMS Plugin"
    since it was originally developed for the Moorea Bioocode Project. It has since been adapted for use in the GeOMe environment.

  <h3 id="video" class="md-headline">Instructional Videos (DEPRECATED)</h3>
  <p>The following videos illustrate how to work with
    <b>Version 1</b> of the GeOMe interface. While these videos have been marked as DEPRECATED, much of the functionality (especially
    with regards to dealing with sequence data) is still applicable to the current interface. We will update these videos
    with current information as soon as we are able.

  <h3 id="dataUsage" class="md-headline">Data usage policy</h3>
  <p style="margin-top:20px;">GeOMe data is subject to the data usage policy developed by the Diversity of the Indopacific Project (the first GeOMe project).
    The data usage policy can be found
