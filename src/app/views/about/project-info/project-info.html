<b>Diversity of the IndoPacific Metadatabase (DIPNet)</b>

<p></p>

Founded in 2012 the Diversity of the Indo-Pacific Network (DIPnet) was created to advance genetic diversity research in the
Indo-Pacific Oceans by aggregating (published) population genetic data into a searchable database so that original datasets
can be utilized to address questions concerning conservation of marine biodiversity. It is our aim to promote collaboration
and advocate best practices for conducting biodiversity research.

<b>Biocode Family of Projects</b>

<p></p>

Founded with the
<a href="http://biocode.berkeley.edu/">Moorea Biocode Project</a> in 2006, the Biocode project family includes a number of projects that have since adopted the
Moorea Biocode database. We are in the process of porting Biocode projects to GeOMe.
