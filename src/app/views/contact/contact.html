    <b>Diversity of the IndoPacific Metadatabase (DIPNet)</b>
    <p>Founded in 2012 the Diversity of the Indo-Pacific Network (DIPnet) was created to advance genetic diversity research
      in the Indo-Pacific Oceans by aggregating (published) population genetic data into a searchable database so that original
      datasets can be utilized to address questions concerning conservation of marine biodiversity. It is our aim to promote
      collaboration and advocate best practices for conducting biodiversity research.</p>
